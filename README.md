# Unofficial Sukritact's Civarium Bugs and Balance Patch

A Civ 6 mod which fixes some bugs with various other mods in [Sukritact's Civarium](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=903467983) and makes some balance changes. I do not own those mods nor am I affiliated with them, but they're quality stuff and just missing a few things.

## Requirements

None! This mod should be compatible with any version of Civ 6, any DLC, and any mod list. Aside from creating localization entries, all of the changes are only applied if the thing they're trying to change already exists. So whether you have none of sukritact's civs or all of them this mod should be safe to use.

## Install Instructions

Clone this repository, then copy the `Sukritact-Patch` folder into your Civ 6 Mods folder (defaults to `C:\Users\<you>\Documents\my games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods` on a Windows Steam install).

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

- Tibet:
    - Add a missing icon size to the icon atlas (fixes weird icons in the civ select screen and missing icons in the world congress)

### Balance Changes

- Tibet:
    - Increase the Desert, Grassland, and Plains Mountain start bias to 2 (up from 3 to match that of the Inca and get the starts a bit more consistent)

### Known Issues

None
